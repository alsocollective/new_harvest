			<h1>How do you make cultured meat a reality?</h1>
			<h3>With science!</h3>
			<p>As the world's leading organization advancing cultured meat since 2004, <a href="http://www.new-harvest.org/2016_year_in_review"><u>New Harvest has already made important strides</u></a> in bringing cultured, animal-free foods closer to supermarket shelves.</p>
			<p>This December, all gifts up to a total of $100,000 will be matched by the Jeremy Coller Foundation. This means that the impact of your donation to advance new, much needed cultured meat research in 2017 will be doubled!</p>

				<p>The environmental impact of beef production is what inspired Mark Post, creator of the world’s first cultured meat hamburger, to start with beef. Skipping showers and doing your part to offset greenhouse gas emissions by riding your bike is one thing, but what if we could bypass the animal and just grow the muscle and fat cells we want, without all the land and water use, cow farts, pollution, and slaughter? If you’re a beef lover who is primarily concerned about the environmental impacts and sustainability of meat production, then cultured beef is where it’s at.</p>

		<p class="bold">Imagine chicken produced from cell culture… that actually tastes like chicken!</p>
		<p>Our insatiable appetite for chicken has led to some pretty freaky changes to the modern breed of chicken most commonly found in factory farms - they’re now selectively bred to grow faster and larger than ever before. And they’re smaller than cows or pigs, so greater numbers of them have to be killed to meet the growing demand for breast meat, drumsticks, and chicken wings. Chickens are by far the most slaughtered land animal in the world, with close to 9 billion killed in the US alone per year. Turkeys come at a close second in the US, at over 232 million slaughtered per year. That’s well over 9 billion reasons to help support cultured avian tissue research.</p>

		<p class="bold">Did you know? Pigs are highly social, intelligent animals with cognitive abilities on par with dogs, dolphins, chimpanzees, and even human toddlers.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately for pigs, they also happen to be the source of delicious bacon. It might seem like a far off dream right now, but being able to culture bacon, pulled pork, pork chops and sausages, and pork rinds (if you’re into that kind of thing) can become a reality, if enough research is supported. Culturing pork meat means getting to enjoy pork products without the guilt, and as an added bonus, hopefully no side of deadly antibiotic resistance either.</p>

	<p class="bold">If you thought the numbers of chickens and turkeys slaughtered per year were bad, you might wanna sit down for this one.</p>
	<p>Exact statistics on the number of sea animals killed for food are hard to come by, but estimates are in the hundreds of billions. We’re eating fish, shrimp, crabs, lobsters, and other sea animals at such an extreme rate that wild populations cannot be sustained. And with ocean pollution on the rise and concerns like mercury toxicity in species like tuna, maybe it’s time to rethink how we source our fish. By growing fish from the cell level up, we’ll no longer need to worry about mercury poisoning, overfishing and extinction, or coming across a parasitic worm in your sashimi.</p>

	<h3>With The 4 Building Blocks of Cultured Meat</h3>

	<h1>Meat Cells</h1>
	<img class="meatcells-img" src="http://data.new-harvest.org/2016/meatcells.svg">
	<p>The meat you eat today is made up of
	muscle and fat cells. We already know that it’s possible to produce meat by growing these cells from culture.
	So far, researchers have had to take
	these cells from slaughtered animals.
	New Harvest wants to change that by
	introducing a line of starter cultures for
	all of the different types of meat that
	exist, and making them available for
	researchers to order via a catalogue,
	rather than a visit to a slaughterhouse.</p>
	<p>We’ve already started working with
	researchers who are developing the first
	cultured meat cell lines in the world,
	starting with turkey. These will be made
	openly available to any and all researchers
	who want to try their hand at furthering
	cultured meat R&amp;D, meaning that instead
	of having just a handful of scientists
	working on cultured meat in the world,
	there can be hundreds, collectively
	furthering advances in the field faster
	than ever before.</p>

	</section><section>
	<h1>Media</h1>
	<img src="http://data.new-harvest.org/2016/media.svg">
	<p>If you’re familiar with tissue culture,
	you may have heard that fetal bovine
	serum is the medium used to grow cell
	cultures in. It’s a very expensive way to
	feed the meat cells, and an unsustainable
	byproduct of the factory farm system. If
	we want cultured meat to be produced
	at the kind of scale where it can be found
	in restaurants and grocery stores, we will
	need to come up with a suitable medium
	that is just as rich in nutrients for the
	cells, but affordable and from a source
	that can be relied upon well into the
	future.</p>
	<p>The good news is that there is a lot of promising research that shows that it is possible to create a completely animal free medium. Not only would finding a
	serum-free medium be groundbreaking
	for cultured meat production, it would also significantly reduce our dependence on animals for all kinds of tissue 	research, like medicine!</p>
	</section><section>
	<h1>Scaffolds</h1>
	<img src="http://data.new-harvest.org/2016/scaffolds.svg">
	<p>Muscle cells need to stick onto a surface
	before they become meat. Whether
	you’re making a hamburger, meatball,
	sausage, or a more structured meat
	product like a chicken breast or steak,
	an edible material for the muscle and
	fat cells to grow on is needed. The
	scaffolds that are currently used in tissue
	engineering are expensive, unsustainable,
	and less than ideal for making a thicker
	cut of meat. What we need is a porous
	(so the cells throughout a 3-dimensional
	structure can be nourished), edible, and
	readily available scaffold that will mimic
	the taste, texture, and composition of
	conventional meat.</p>
	</section><section>
	<h1>Bioreactor</h1>
	<img class="bioreactor-img" src="http://data.new-harvest.org/2016/bioreactor.png">
	<p>Once it’s ready for consumers to eat,
	cultured meat won’t be made in test
	tubes or petri dishes. In order for it to
	become a reasonably priced product, it
	needs to be produced in industrial scale
	bioreactors (a bioreactor is a machine
	which influences biological processes,
	like the growth of muscle and fat tissue),
	similar to what you’d find in a modern
	beer brewery today. Currently, there is
	still a need to obtain the fundamental
	data on the amount and type of inputs
	(including feed for the cells, and the
	energy requirements) for the cells to
	grow in the most efficient way possible,
	and this will inform the bioreactor design.</p>
	<p>We are working with engineers with
	the right expertise to develop brewery-type
	machinery specially designed to
	grow muscle cells for the production of
	cultured meat.</p>
