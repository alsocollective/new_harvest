			<!--	<h2>What We Do</h2>
				<p>New Harvest is a registered 501(c)(3) public charity advancing technologies to sustainably and affordably feed a growing global population.</p>
				<p>New Harvest is most recognized for advancing meat and milk produced in cell culture. By producing these products this way, food production can be less resource intensive, more environmentally friendly, less prone to contamination, and more humane.</p>
				<blockquote><p>I am an engineer who has been passionate about producing real milk in a better way for a while now. Through New Harvest, I was connected with the immense opportunity of receiving funding and lab space for several months. New Harvest&rsquo;s powerful network and global audience has accelerated our milk start-up from an just an idea to multi-million dollar funding contracts within months.

					<h2>Who we are</h2>
					<p>New Harvest is a registered 501(c)(3) public charity in the United States.</p>
					<p>New Harvest is a catalytic grantmaking organization accelerating breakthroughs in cellular agriculture.</p> 
					<p>We are the gravitational pull for a constellation of pioneers in cellular agriculture: scientists, entrepreneurs, investors, food companies, NGOs, and international organizations like the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.</p> 
					<p>We are funded by people like you, people who care to change the way we make animal products.</p> 
				</div>
				<div id="what-we-do">
					<h2>What We Do</h2>
					<p>We are spearheading the next agricultural revolution: Cellular Agriculture.</p>
					<p>Cellular agriculture means farming cells in cultures to harvest milk, eggs, meat, leather, fur, rhino horn, and any other animal products from cell cultures rather than from animals.</p>  
					<p>Cellular agriculture is a groundbreaking field that is still not adequately supported by established funding channels.</p>
					<p>This is where New Harvest comes in:</p>
				
					<h3>WE FUND</h3> 
					<ul>
						<li>researchers making discoveries</li> 
						<li>in cellular agriculture but lacking</li>  
						<li>support from traditional channels in</li> 
						<li>industry or academia.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>WE LAUNCH & INCUBATE</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>biotechnology companies creating cellular agriculture products.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>WE CONVENE AND INFORM</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>scientists, NGOs, entrepreneurs, food</li> 
						<li>companies, donors and investors</li>
						<li>committed to ushering in the next revolution in agriculture.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>We are planting the seeds of a new bioeconomy by building a new industry supported by a vibrant research community.</p>

				<div id="mission-vision">
					<h2>Mission & Vision</h2>
					<p>Our mission is to kickstart a post-animal bioeconomy.</p>
					<p>Our vision is a resilient, vibrant, bioeconomy where we harvest animal products from cell cultures, not animals.</p>
					<p>It is time to re-think the supply chain of animal products.</p>
					<p>By applying the medical advances in tissue engineering and cell cultures to growing food, we can revolutionize the supply chain of animal products to continue to provide affordable and sustainable food to a growing population.</p>  
					<p>Thanks to cellular agriculture, we can produce eggs, milk, meat and more in a brewery-type fermentation process without intensive crop and animal farming.</p>
					<p>Our goal is to plant the seeds of a thriving bioeconomy supported by an entrepreneurial, well-funded, research community.</p>
