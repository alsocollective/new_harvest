				<h2>What We Do</h2>
				<p>New Harvest is a registered 501(c)(3) public charity advancing technologies to sustainably and affordably feed a growing global population.</p>
				<p>New Harvest is most recognized for advancing meat and milk produced in cell culture. By producing these products this way, food production can be less resource intensive, more environmentally friendly, less prone to contamination, and more humane.</p>
				<blockquote>I am an engineer who has been passionate about producing real milk in a better way for a while now. Through New Harvest, I was connected with the immense opportunity of receiving funding and lab space for several months. New Harvest&rsquo;s powerful network and global audience has accelerated our milk start-up from an just an idea to multi-million dollar funding contracts within months.	&mdash;Ryan Pandya of Muufri
